# NYPD Shooting Incident History

The goal of this study is to find what factors could be contributing to shootings in New York. 
We will look at factors such as victim traits, location, day of the week, and time of day. We will 
then discuss other factors not seen in this data set and how those could be impacting our data as
an outside influence. Finally, we will discuss the impact that those outside factors and biases have 
on studies.
